## Filtration Area
For the calculation of dust collectors efficiency. Collectors based on filter bags.

For:
- filter bag diameter
- permeability factor of filter fabric
- quantity of filters used in dust collector
- assumed efficiency of the dust collector

is calculated:
- surface area of single bag
- total surface are for quantity of filters used in dust collector
- permeability factor of filter fabric for given quantity of filters and collector's efficiency
- quantity of filters must be used in dust collector for assumed efficiency and permeability factor
